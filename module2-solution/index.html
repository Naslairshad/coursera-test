      	<p>
      		Beef is very popular and the second most consumed meat in China following pork. Beef is known as the "King of Meat" in China because of its high protein content, low-fat content, and delicious taste.It also contains various trace elements including iron, zinc, selenium, manganese, and a variety of the B vitamins. Beef is more of a select meat in China as there is very little land spare to graze cattle. It is sometimes considerably more expensive than pork, the Chinese staple meat.Water buffalo or yak may be used instead of cow meat in some parts of China. In southern China, the bovine of choice is not a dairy cow but a water buffalo, used for tilling rice paddies.

      		Long, thin rolls typically featuring just one ingredient like a strip of fresh tuna, cucumber, or pickled daikon are called hosomaki. Futomaki (futo meaning fat) is a thicker variety of makizushi, and includes a combination of complimentary ingredients. Futomaki, unlike in foreign countries, is less likely to appear at sushi restaurants, but can usually be found in bento boxes and supermarkets. Uramaki, often called “inside-out sushi” in English, is a modern version of makizushi believed to have been invented in California in the 1960s. It’s made by first layering the rice onto the bamboo sushi mat, then laying the nori sheet on top followed by the remaining ingredients, before rolling.
